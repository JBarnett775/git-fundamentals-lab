- How to merge branches
- How pull requests work on GitHub

## Git Commands Practiced

- git init
- git add
- git commit
- git branch
- git switch
- git merge
- git push

## Why This Matters for DevOps

Version control is essential in DevOps and cloud engineering.
Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform rely heavily on Git workflows.
Understanding branching and pull requests is critical for CI/CD pipelines.
